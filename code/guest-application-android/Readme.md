## Overview

The Eventiz Android Guest Application is designed to provide guests with a seamless experience during events. Guests can access real-time sensor values, scan their NFC bracelets to locate their stored belongings on designated racks, and send emergency alerts to staff in case of incidents like fires. The application also ensures that guests stay informed by receiving real-time notifications about event announcements and warnings, such as unhealthy CO2 values.
