## Overview

The Eventiz visitor information application is an application that visualizes: 
 - Announcements from the organisation.
 - The amount of free racks in the cloakroom. 
 - The the temperature & air quality in the event hall.

for everyone attending the event, giving them a clear overview of what is going on upon arrival.  

The application gets the announcements from our Strapi CMS. The communication for the temperature and air quality is facilitated through integration with a Laravel API and a websocket server.
