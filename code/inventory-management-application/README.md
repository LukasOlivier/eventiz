## Overview

The Eventiz inventory management application is an application available for the staff members of the event. With this easy-to-use application the staff members are able to scan the provided NFC bracelets and assign a rack number & name to the bracelet. When the visitor wants his/her clothes back, the staff member can scan the NFC bracelets and see where to find his/her clothes. 

The communication for the sensor data and the rack data is facilitated through integration with a Laravel API and a websocket server.
